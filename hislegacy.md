# Hölderlin in Retrospect 
The reception of Hölderlin's work was conditioned by the rise of bureaucracy, commerce, governance based on sovereignty over a territory rather than personal obligations, the rule of law, and nationalism in German-speaking Europe. By the time that the Kingdom of Prussia headed the formation of a German national state in 1871, the Holy Roman Empire of Hölderlin's life and the imagined Germany of his hopes seemed distant and cloudy. As a professional middle class found careers in the bureaucracy, they began to enforce their own expectations of behavior on people and evaluate their quality according to their conformity to these mores of self-responsibility and respectability. They first subjected Hölderlin's legacy to the scrutiny of middle class morality during his lifetime.

# Hölderlin as a Madman
After his 1807 discharge from the Tübingen University asylum, Hölderlin began living under the care of his admirer, the carpenter Ernst Zimmer. Zimmer housed the poet in a riverside tower that the carpenter had previously rented out to students of the local Tübingen University. The poet began to become something of a local attraction to the residents of the academic town. Students and admirers came to the riverfront tower that Hölderlin lived in to see the poet in his condition of madness. Some would ask him to write them poems as gifts, and he sometimes obliged. The writer Wilhelm Waiblinger was one such visitor, seeing Hölderlin often enough to get to know him. He wrote the most detailed initial account and analysis of Hölderlin’s madness, which he completed in 1828. Waiblinger believed that he could perceive the psychological basis for Hölderlin’s madness in his character itself: “You could stretch a point and locate his destiny in his unhappily fine spiritual organization. At length, under the pressure of  all too many disillusionments, malign events and melancholy convergences, it imploded.”[^note5]

By refusing to compromise with the way of the world, Waiblinger believed, Hölderlin had finally snapped when the disappointments of European politics and his personal life overwhelmed him. For evidence of the poet’s madness, Waiblinger noted of his physiognomy: “You observe the desolating traces of mental illness in the cheeks, the mouth, the nose, and above the eyes (where there appears a deep painful crease). You notice with regret and sadness the convulsion that shivers on occasion through his whole face, that causes his shoulders to shrug sharply, and that makes his hands and fingers inordinately twitchy.”[^note6] The poet would greet people with excessive formality, his manners giving off “an aura of rigidity.”[^note7] He estimated Hölderlin in his tower as basically a shell of a person, suffering “a condition not of lunacy so much as weakness, and everything with the appearance of unreason that he manifests is a consequence of spiritual and corporeal exhaustion.”[^note8] Waiblinger claimed that Hölderlin’s madness had led to a sharp decline in the frequency and quality of his writing, leaving him incapable of writing anything except for brief fragments of poems. Waiblinger believed that the poet’s condition stemmed from his fear of death, arguing that Hölderlin’s condition was the result of a certain weakness of will and inability to go on with the stresses of everyday life. He described Hölderlin as often agitated by his visitors, demonstrating an “aversion to even hazarding the attempt, to acknowledging another person.”[^note9]

Though the decline of Hölderlin’s mental health became obvious with his long bouts of non-responsiveness after 1806, he had long written about Romantic retreats from a disappointing world. In 1799, he had concluded his poetic novel Hyperion by having the eponymous protagonist flee from Ottoman Imperial attacks on Greece to Germany. There, the submissiveness of the German people to despotic authority disgusted him enough that he decided to abandon society and become a hermit in the woods. While departing from the company of other people, Hyperion expressed his intention to reunite with nature, declaring: “we are all sprung from the same golden seed!”[^note10] Hölderlin continued to pursue similar themes in the works that he produced while under the care of Zimmer. The majority of his works from this time period cannot be dated with certainty, since Hölderlin neither dated nor published them, but they usually drew on personal experiences which continued throughout the entire period. For example, he penned the poem “The Merry Life” about the solo walks that he often took by the Neckar riverfront. He described these walks as soothing of his mental condition. It is possible that this sightseeing was a way for him to continue to live out his Romantic ideals after the rest of his former associates had left them behind in favor of middle class professional careers. The poem, translated to English, reads as follows:

> “When I come to walk the meadow,/
> Later, reach the field below,/
> Still I am the tame, the pious,/
> As by thorns uninjured go.
>
> In the wind my garment flutters/
> While I gaily think upon/
> What our inner life consists of/
> Till its dissolution’s dawn.
>
> Oh before this gentle image/
> Where the green trees line the sky/
> As before a tavern’s emblem/
> Hardly I can just pass by/
> For the peace on days all quiet/
> Is true excellence, in my view;/
> This you should not even ask me/
> If I am to answer you.
>
> But towards the lovely brook now/
> For a pleasant path I peer/
> Which, as in a fine apartment,/
> Creeps through banks all wild and sheer,/
> Where the footbridge runs across it,/
> To the lovely woodland ways/
> Where the breeze blows round the footbridge/
> Upward happily I gaze.
>
> Sitting on that hilltop yonder/
> After noon I spend my time,/
> And I hear the clock tower chime,/
> Contemplation gives the heart a/
> Peace, whatever bodes the while,/
> And a soothing of the sorrows/
> That our reason rhymes with guile.
>
> Dearest landscape! where the roadway/
> Runs right through, all level, straight,/
> Where the moon, the pale, is rising/
> When the evening wind’s in spate,/
> Where nature’s mind is very simple,/
> Lofty mountains loom and shine,/
> I go home at last, domestic,/
> There to see golden wine.”
[^note11]

Throughout the poem, Hölderlin described a therapeutic role for his experiences of nature and artistic output. While describing the beginning of his nature walk, he wrote: “In the wind my garment flutters/While I gaily think upon/What our inner life consists of/Till its dissolution’s dawn.” He appeared to associate the gayness of the thought with the indulgence of inner life, while he followed that pleasure with the haunting thought of death’s inevitability. Hölderlin’s caretakers and associates described him as terrified of his own mortality. By placing an acknowledgement of his own finitude at the end of the first stanza, which describes the beginning of his walk, he made this worry into a guiding thread in the poem. The poem reinforces this reading in a later stanza, which says that “Contemplation gives the heart a/Peace, whatever bodes the while,/And a soothing of the sorrows/That our reason rhymes with guile.” This spells out the therapeutic function that united Hölderlin’s walks and writing. Both served as safe, comfortable settings for contemplation, freeing him from the worries and responsibilities of everyday life. While in quotidian life, he was troubled by the “sorrows” that “our reason rhymes with guile,” since it did not allow him to retreat from them, walking and writing allowed Hölderlin to forget his problems through the peaceful activity of contemplation. 

Hölderlin directly addressed the audience of the poem only once. After describing his enjoyment of the treeline, he remarked: “For the peace on days all quiet/Is true excellence, in my view;/This you should not even ask me/If I am to answer you.” The “you” he addressed seems to be personally familiar, reinforced by the fact that he uses the familiar and singular “du” in the original German. The “you” was likely someone who asks him about his thoughts often, since he offered an answer before they could even ask the expected question of what he believed true excellence is. It is possible that the singular “you” may refer to Ernest Zimmer, Hölderlin’s caretaker, or one of his visitors. That Hölderlin’s ideal was for a quiet peace reinforces the text’s fixation on the poet’s inner contemplation. 

The poem linked the therapeutic practice of contemplation with the power of nature. Hölderlin described the landscape in terms that began at a small scale, with meadows and fields, before unfolding into the entire landscape and the night sky. Throughout the poem, Hölderlin attributed nurturing characteristics to nature. He began the poem with the lines: “When I come to walk the meadow,/Later, reach the field below,/Still I am the tame, the pious,/As by thorns uninjured go.” By following his description of himself as “the tame, the pious” with his description of passing by thorns “uninjured,” he seemed to imply a link between his inner state and the outer gentleness of nature when he passed through the landscape. Throughout the stanzas, he used peaceful imagery of homely places to describe the sights on his walk, such as “a tavern’s emblem,” “a fine apartment,” and the conclusion of the evening with “golden wine.” Each scene he described of his enjoying the landscape was tied to images of comfort, safety, and respite. He associated the character of respite in the landscape with the fact that it is a setting where “nature’s mind is very simple.” The soothing function he attributed to contemplation was made possible by the gentleness and simplicity of the landscape that he walked through. While the bustling life of the quotidian and the responsibility to conduct oneself rationally brought complications to things, the landscape offered respite to the poet’s inner life in its simplicity.

In this late era of his life, Hölderlin seemed to see his ideals as only being realizable when he was left to himself. While wrote of the landscape of Tübingen as soothing his worries, Waiblinger’s account reveals that he found the stress and intensity of being observed to be upsetting. This resonates with a clinical phenomenon that historian Ann Goldberg describes in her study Sex, Religion and the Making of Modern Madness: The Eberbach Asylum and German Society, 1815-1849. Christian peasant patients at the Eberbach asylum drew on the strength of their religious convictions to resist the authority of the doctors. Rather than cooperating, they retreated into the inner sanctum of a spiritual relationship with God and found “an empowering set of tools to resist worldly authority.”[^note12] Though he did not come from a peasant background, Hölderlin’s aesthetic ideals were tied with his religious convictions, which were a mix of his family’s Pietist Christianity and the Hellenic paganism that he admired so strongly. Though he was no longer held as a patient in an asylum, he was still under observation as a madman. Like the patients of Eberbach, he was reinvigorated when he could live according to his ideals instead of being forced into the role of either a madman or a model patient for the people around him. 


## Hölderlin as a Case Study

Though Hölderlin gave his own account of his condition in his late work, these poems were relegated to obscurity for the remainder of the 19th century. Waiblinger’s account of Hölderlin’s madness became the most well-known source of the poet’s later life. Waiblinger’s interpretation of the poet’s condition influenced how later generations of German intellectuals received the poet’s work. Waiblinger had a low estimation of Hölderlin’s late poetry, more or less dismissing it as the inferior output of a wrecked man. His assessment was repeated by many of the intellectuals who drew on his account of Hölderlin’s condition. While Hölderlin had experienced a very early form of the asylum system, he had been a patient in a time when the treatment of mental health in Germany was decentralized, rural, and dominated by the ad hoc practices of middle-class alienists. After failing to cure him, and on his own personal authority, the alienist Autenrieth released Hölderlin as a hopeless case and a doomed man. 

Across the rest of the 19th century, a more standardized system began to develop in many of the German states that had succeeded the Holy Roman Empire. In 1871, the Kingdom of Prussia oversaw the unification of a new German national state. As the intellectuals of the new state set to work building new professions as part of a growing national bureaucracy, clinical psychiatry began to grow in the university system of the Empire. In the remaining decades of the 19th century, they set to work producing a scientific consensus within the psychiatric profession by creating journals and using the earlier publications of psychiatrists as textbooks. Instead of relying on the individual analyses of symptoms that the alienists had practiced, psychiatrists like Karl Kahlbaum and Emil Kraepelin developed a system of standardized treatment based on diagnosing patients according to the patterns in their symptoms and treating them with methods that were consistent across patients. The work system of clinics adapted this diagnostic system to a complex division of labor that combined staff, doctors, and patients in an efficient national system of treatment. The system’s ability to achieve the same successful results each time helped the psychiatric professionals achieve the court system’s recognition of them as legitimate, giving them an expanded power to decide which members of society were in need of their expert care. 

A major part of this strategy of building consensus, and therefore juridicial legitimacy, was to engage with public opinion through publishing on cultural topics. Historian Eric Engstrom notes in Clinical Psychiatry in Imperial Germany: A History of Psychiatric Practice that insanity was addressed as a national problem in the discourse of late 19th century Germany in a “veritable flood of literature” that “inundated the book market as authors and publishers competed for readers' interest.”[^note13] Insanity meant many things to many people, from a problem of finances and status for the patients and their families to a problem of medical and scientific theory and practice for doctors and scientists. For the bourgeois public that psychiatrists were trying to win over, it meant a problem of madmen failing to pursue the ideal of self-cultivation and self-education and instead stagnating in their condition. 

These concerns all informed the first comprehensive psychiatric analysis of Hölderlin and his work. The analysis, written by the University of Tübingen psychiatrist Wilhelm Lange-Eichbaum, was published as the book Hölderlin: A Pathography in 1909. Only non-medical writers had previously attempted to diagnose Hölderllin. Lange-Eichbaum identified Möbius’s 1901 article “Hölderlin’s Love Life,” which described the poet as suffering from dementia praecox, and C.F. van Vleuten’s 1906 article “The Mental Disorder of Friedrich Hölderlin,” which expanded the diagnosis to dementia praecox cataconica, as the only useful medical judgements of Hölderlin’s condition. By pointing to dementia praecox and catatonia, both of these analyses drew on diagnostic language developed by psychiatrists Karl Kahlbaum and Emil Kraepelin. Kahlbaum had interpreted this condition, characterized by a patient’s non-responsiveness and muscular tension, as both psychological and neurological, lacking a singular cause. Kraepelin, on the other hand, believed that it was a result of a terminal weakness of the will that would inevitably end in dementia.[^note14] In the case of Hölderlin, Lange-Eichbaum believed that all other assessments of the poet’s mental illness fell short of the standards of psychiatric diagnosis by interpreting “an undoubtedly organic brain disease, catatonia, as arising directly from psychic causes, e.g., from grief, from disappointments, from ‘mental pain’—a view whose erroneousness cannot be emphasized too strongly.”[^note15]

Lange-Eichbaum retrospectively diagnosed Hölderlin with catatonia on the basis of the symptoms described by Waiblinger, particularly his long periods of non-responsiveness and facial twitching. Echoing Waiblinger’s assessment of the poet as stricken by a weakness of the will, he said that Hölderlin had “nerves but no muscles, feeling and pride, but no energy,” and “was a passive nature.”[^note16]: With the condescension of history, and from the perspective of a responsible middle class professional, he claimed that Hölderlin’s Romantic traits “are to be considered identical with those of his psychopathy.”[^note17] The psychiatrist blamed Hölderlin’s madness on a family history of catatonia, inherited by the poet through genetics and his mother’s effeminate conditioning, and culminating in a physical degeneration of the brain. He somewhat trailed Waiblinger’s assessment of his late work, arguing that his catatonia impeded his ability to continue to work on large-scale projects like the revision of Hyperion. Lange-Eichbaum, however, ceded that he continued to write short poems of high quality. Lange-Eichbaum’s assessment of Hölderlin introduced a psychiatric analysis of the poet to the public, perhaps seeking to prove that psychiatry was truly a well-rounded human science that could address the problems of human culture. As if to assert that psychiatrists could take part in the deepest questions of existence, Lange-Eichbaum estimated Hölderlin as a universal figure: “He had created something imperishable, and his reward was something that surpassed death in harshness and bitterness[...] In his fate, Hölderlin seems a symbol of the tragedy of humanity.”[^note18]

## Hölderlin as a Message
Wilhelm Lange-Eichbaum’s characterization of Hölderlin and his late work as a case study in dementia praecox cataconica was not shared by everyone in the German intellectual scene. In the beginning of the 20th century, many Germans felt disenchanted by the central role of commerce and bureaucracy in society. Some turned back to the ideals of the Romantics for an alternative to the ‘cold’ and ‘impersonal’ worldviews offered by sciences like psychiatry. Munich scholar Norbert von Hellingrath was part of one such circle of intellectuals, writers, and poets who sought to revive Romanticism. A disciple of the poet Stefan George, Hellingrath believed that modern German society had lost its way. He thought that Hölderlin and his ideals offered a message of rebirth to the Germans of his day.

Hellingrath set to work compiling, dating, and publishing the poet’s work to rescue him from obscurity. For the first time, he began to publish all of Hölderlin’s late works, which few had previously offered much credence to. Hellingrath did not see the late works as discounted by the poet’s madness. In a 1915 address to the public titled “Hölderlin’s Madness,” he argued that the poet’s life and work must rather be thought of as an organic, inseparable totality. Madness was the culmination of his destiny, and his destiny was to channel the spiritual powers of his muses. Drawing on concepts which were current in George’s circle, Hellingrath ascribed a mystical significance to Hölderlin’s madness: “Life and work behave like the voice and gesture of a speaker: soon the words, soon the gesture seem to us to say more, life is completely filled and absorbed by the work, and the work is life.”[^note19] He interpreted the poet as a conduit for the pagan gods of Ancient Greece and Germany. Hölderlin’s madness was part of his message to Germany. His last poems were not merely the scribblings of a madman, but experimentations in a new language and in a way of returning to nature. Hellingrath often interpreted Hölderlin in nationalist terms, believing that he had transmitted a message of the destiny of the German people in his poems. This nationalist interpretation of the poet’s works served to re-legitimize the late poems for many in the German public, who could now read and interpret the texts for themselves.


## Hölderlin as a Prophet
After salvaging Hölderlin’s late works and justifying them in nationalist terms for the German public, Norbert von Hellingrath succeeded at re-introducing the poet into intellectual discourse. Poets and philosophers began to draw on Hölderlin as an inspiration for their own attempts at addressing the problems they perceived in German society. The Austrian Expressionist poet Georg Trakl, famous for his apocalyptic descriptions of World War I, looked on Hölderlin as a great innovator in experimenting with poetic language. In retrospect, the poet appeared as a forefather of literary modernism. 

In 1918, a social revolution established a republic in Germany. In the future, while the country would pass between dictatorships and democracy, it would remain a republic. The political ideals of Hölderlin, which Hellingrath had pointed his audience to, attained a new significance for Germans in the republican era. Philosophers on both the political left and political right estimated Hölderlin as a prophet of their ideals. The nationalist philosopher Martin Heidegger spent the latter half of World War II lecturing on Hölderlin’s poems. Jewish communist intellectuals like Walter Benjamin and Theodor Adorno took Hölderlin’s love of nature and attempts at expressing natural scenes in poetic language as inspirations for their own critiques of modern capitalist civilization.

{% include figure.html class="right" width="40%" caption="Philosopher Martin Heidegger, who spent much of his career interpreting Hölderlin's later work as a prophecy" image-path="scrollstory/images/martin-heidegger-philosopher.jpg" %}

The politically contradictory interpretations of the poet as a prophet extended to the national scale as well. During the latter half of World War II, the Nazi regime often praised Hölderlin and his work as “pure,” using his poems as a source of consolation to a failing war effort. The Hölderlin Society printed poems to be sent with the supplies that were distributed to Wehrmacht soldiers on the Eastern Front. At the same time, pro-Soviet German Communists like playwright and poet Bertolt Brecht invoked Hölderlin as a revolutionary against the anti-communist nationalism of the Nazis. Both Nazis and anti-fascists sought to claim Hölderlin as one of them. 

This reinterpretation of Hölderlin as a prophet across the political spectrum led to a reassessment of his late work as holding not only intellectual value but a national significance for German culture as a whole. While not every admirer agreed with Hellingrath’s interpretation of the poet, they ultimately drew on the work he had done to redeem the poet from historical obscurity. Seeking to make things right between his two fields, psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers argued that psychiatric writers ought to focus only on the life of Hölderlin to evaluate his illness, while in his work: "One can but observe, irrespective of his illness, an uninterruptedly progressing development which does not suffer a bruise until later during his illness."[^note20] Though many continued to hold that his biography and his extant works justified retrospectively diagnosing him with catatonia, psychiatrists now had to concede that the poet's late work was aesthetically significant. Intellectuals no longer remembered Hölderlin as a madman and a failure, a man who produced low-quality works, but as a prophet of a world that came long after his death. The German government now treats Hölderlin as a cultural forefather of the entire Republic. By claiming his late work as a prophecy, the German literary public has transformed an impoverished and isolated man into a symbol of their world.[^note21]
